# Filmz

Keeping track of my films and series. The ones I saw as well as the ones I want to see. And wether I liked them, so that I can recommend them to friends.



The main user flows are:

* User open the app and sees a list of his films (i.e. MyFilm entries).
* User can add a new film to the list: He can search for a film by title and then add it to his list. This is also where he enters his data about the film.
* User can see & edit the details of a film: He can see the details of a film from his list. This includes the data he entered as well as the data from IMDB.

Some key services & protocols I have:

* ImdbFilmService: Fetches the data from IMDB about a film.
  * searchFilms(query: String)  
  * fetchMovieDetails(imdbId: String) -> ImdbFilm
* MyFilmRepository: A protocol with basic functions:
  * fetchAllMyFilms()
  * addMyFilm(myFilm: MyFilm)
  * updateMyFilm(myFilm: MyFilm)
  * deleteMyFilm(myFilm: MyFilm)
* CKMyFilmRepository: A concrete implementation of MyFilmRepository that uses iCloudKit to store the data.
* MyFilmStore: A class that manages the data in the app. It uses CKMyFilmRepository to store the data.

The basic views that make up my app are:

* MyFilmListView: Shows a list of films. It uses MyFilmStore to fetch the data.
* MyFilmDetailView: Shows the details of a film. 
* ImdbFilmDetailView: Shows the details of a film from IMDB. It uses ImdbFilmService to fetch the data.

## Filmz structure

The Film class contains both data from IMDB as well as my own data about it:

### Retrieving from OMDB

Since I use the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/), here are some test search requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=1b5a29bf&s=batman" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

A sample result:

### Movie databases 

I need a movie database to query in the background. Here are some options I found:

* [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/): I think it's a download of the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdb.org/) (OMDB) and makes the content available via API. Free, but limited to 1000 requests per day. 
* [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/): To get a commercial license I need to email them.
* ~~[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/): The API is crazyyy expensive ($150,000 plus metered costs ðŸ˜€)~~

Other services to look at:

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/)
* [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)
