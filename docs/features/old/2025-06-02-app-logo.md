# Feature: App Logo

## Overview

Implement a custom app logo for Filmz2 to establish brand identity and improve visual appeal. The logo will be used as the app icon across all platforms and potentially within the app interface.

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want to** see a distinctive app icon  
**So that** I can easily identify and launch the Filmz2 app from my device

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Logo asset created in all required sizes for iOS/macOS
- [ ] Logo properly displayed as app icon on all devices
- [ ] Logo maintains clarity and recognition at all sizes
- [ ] Logo follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for app icons
- [ ] Asset catalog properly configured with all icon variants

## Visual Design

### Logo Design

The logo is already designed and available at: `/docs/features/2025-06-02-app-logo/filmz.png`

A Python script for generating all required icon sizes is also available at: `/docs/features/2025-06-02-app-logo/generate_app_icons.py`

### Required Icon Sizes

For iOS:

- 20pt (2x, 3x) - Notification
- 29pt (2x, 3x) - Settings
- 40pt (2x, 3x) - Spotlight
- 60pt (2x, 3x) - App Icon
- 1024pt (1x) - App Store

For macOS:

- 16pt (1x, 2x)
- 32pt (1x, 2x)
- 128pt (1x, 2x)
- 256pt (1x, 2x)
- 512pt (1x, 2x)

### Design Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with no transparency for app icons
- **Color Space**: sRGB
- **Shape**: Square (system will apply appropriate masking)
- **Margins**: Follow Apple's safe area guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### Asset Creation Process

1. Export logo from source file at required sizes
2. Ensure proper color profile (sRGB)
3. Remove any transparency for app icon versions
4. Apply any platform-specific adjustments

### Asset Catalog Configuration

Update `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json`:

```json
{
  "images" : [
    {
      "idiom" : "iphone",
      "scale" : "2x",
      "size" : "20x20"
    },
    // ... additional entries for all sizes
  ]
}
```

### Architecture

- **Asset Location**: `filmz2/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
- **Source Image**: `docs/features/2025-06-02-UI-improvements/filmz.png`

### Dependencies

- [ ] Image editing software for size exports
- [ ] Asset catalog in Xcode project

## User Flow

1. User installs app → sees logo on home screen
2. User searches for app → logo appears in search results
3. User views app in App Store → high-resolution logo displayed
4. User receives notification → small logo appears in notification

## Edge Cases

1. **Dark Mode**
   - Scenario: Device in dark mode
   - Expected behavior: Logo remains clearly visible and recognizable

2. **Small Sizes**
   - Scenario: Logo displayed at 20pt
   - Expected behavior: Key elements remain distinguishable

## Testing Requirements

### Visual Tests

- [ ] Verify logo displays correctly on all device sizes
- [ ] Test appearance in light and dark modes
- [ ] Confirm no pixelation or blurriness at any size
- [ ] Validate proper masking on iOS (rounded corners)

### Technical Tests

- [ ] Verify all required sizes are present in asset catalog
- [ ] Confirm no build warnings about missing icons
- [ ] Test on physical devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac)

## Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure sufficient contrast for visibility
- [ ] Logo should be recognizable without relying on color alone
- [ ] Consider how logo appears to users with color blindness

## Performance Considerations

- **File Size**: Optimize PNG compression while maintaining quality
- **Loading**: App icons are cached by system, minimal performance impact

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Ensure logo assets are included in app bundle
- [ ] No external loading of icon resources

## Analytics

Track the following events:

- [ ] App icon taps from home screen (if measurable)
- [ ] App launches from different contexts

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Seasonal icon variants for special occasions
- [ ] Dynamic icon options for user personalization
- [ ] In-app logo animations for splash screen

## Definition of Done

- [x] All required icon sizes generated and added to asset catalog
- [ ] App builds without icon-related warnings
- [ ] Icons display correctly on all target devices
- [ ] Visual quality approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated with icon specifications
