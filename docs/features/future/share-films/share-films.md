As a user I want to be able to share films: On a film of my collection i click on the Apple standard "share" logo and get the standard dialogue on how to share (i.e. iMessage, email... or copy link). This link is then sent (let's say via iMessage) to my friend.

My friend gets the link on iMessage, clicks it and the Filmz2 app opens with the new film.

For him the new film has different areas:

* The IMDB film part about the film itself
* His "My Data" section that he can edit
* A section "Community Data" in which he sees the average rating of other filmz users and comments that have been passed along.

When sending i can select wether my comments should be sent along. If so, they are visible in the "Comunity Data" field of the recieving user. Whenever I change my comments, the changes are also visible in the views at the receiving user.

In the receiving user's My Data/Recommended by my name appears. But the receiving user can overwrite it.
