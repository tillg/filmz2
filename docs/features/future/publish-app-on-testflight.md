# Publish App on TestFlight

## Overview

Set up the complete process for publishing the Filmz2 app to TestFlight for beta testing, including all necessary configurations, certificates, and deployment automation.

## Goals

- Enable beta distribution to test users
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- Configure app signing and provisioning profiles
- Set up TestFlight groups and user management

Everything that can be done by editing the code base should be done this way. For the manual processes (i.e. creating entries in Apple systems thru different websites etc) there should be precise step-by-step guides.

## Key Components

- Apple Developer Program enrollment
- App Store Connect configuration
- Xcode build settings optimization
- Automated build and upload process
- Beta testing workflow documentation

## Success Criteria

- App successfully uploads to TestFlight
- Beta testers can install and run the app
- Automated deployment process is functional
- Clear documentation for future releases
