# SwiftUI in 2025: Forget MVVM

Apple WWDC19, SwiftUI launch: Data Flow Through SwiftUI

It‚Äôs 2025, and I‚Äôm still getting asked the same question: ‚ÄúWhere are your ViewModels?‚Äù Every time I share this opinion or code from my open-source projects like my BlueSky client, IcySky, or even the Medium iOS app, developers are surprised to see clean, simple views without a single ViewModel in sight.
Let me be clear: you don‚Äôt need ViewModels in SwiftUI.
You never did.
You never will.

## The MVVM Trap

When SwiftUI launched in 2019, many developers brought their UIKit baggage with them. We were so used to the Massive View Controller (MVC) problem that we immediately reached for MVVM as our savior. But here‚Äôs the thing, SwiftUI isn‚Äôt UIKit. It was designed from the ground up with a different philosophy.

And this philosophy is highlighted in various WWDC videos from Apple:

* [Data Flow Through SwiftUI - WWDC19](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/226/?source=post_page-----262ff2bbd2ed---------------------------------------)
* [Discover Observation in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10149/?source=post_page-----262ff2bbd2ed---------------------------------------)
* [Data Essentials in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10040/?source=post_page-----262ff2bbd2ed---------------------------------------)

Those are all very good sessions, and they barely mention any ViewModel.

Why? Because it‚Äôs simply almost alien to the built with the data flow of SwiftUI views.

Actually, it‚Äôs not even my first story on this very topic, I have another contentious article below üôÉ

[Removing the M from MVVM with SwiftUI](https://blog.stackademic.com/removing-the-m-from-mvvm-with-swiftui-a58b239e9e3e)

SwiftUI views are structs, not classes. They‚Äôre designed to be lightweight, disposable, and recreated frequently. When adding a ViewModel, you fight against this fundamental design principle.
Views as Pure State Expressions
In my latest IcySky app, every view follows the same pattern I‚Äôve advocated for years. Let me show you what I mean with a real example:

```swift
struct FeedView: View {
    @Environment(BlueSkyClient.self) private var client
    @Environment(AppTheme.self) private var theme
    
    enum ViewState {
        case loading
        case error(String)
        case loaded([Post])
    }
    
    @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading
    @State private var isRefreshing = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                switch viewState {
                case .loading:
                    ProgressView("Loading feed...")
                        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                        .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
                        
                case .error(let message):
                    ErrorStateView(
                        message: message,
                        retryAction: { await loadFeed() }
                    )
                    .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
                    
                case .loaded(let posts):
                    ForEach(posts) { post in
                        PostRowView(post: post)
                            .listRowInsets(.init())
                    }
                }
            }
            .listStyle(.plain)
            .refreshable { await refreshFeed() }
            .task { await loadFeed() }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice what‚Äôs happening here. The view state is defined right within the view using an enum. No external ViewModel needed. The view is literally just a representation of its state ‚Äî nothing more, nothing less.

## The Magic of Environment

This is where SwiftUI shines. Instead of manually injecting dependencies through ViewModels, I use Environment:

```swift
@Environment(BlueSkyClient.self) private var client

private func loadFeed() async {
    do {
        let posts = try await client.getFeed()
        viewState = .loaded(posts)
    } catch {
        viewState = .error(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}

private func refreshFeed() async {
    defer { isRefreshing = false }
    isRefreshing = true
    await loadFeed()
}
```

My `BlueSkyClient` is injected through the Environment, tested independently, and handles all the networking complexity. The view just orchestrates the user interface flow.

## Real-World Complexity

‚ÄúBut Thomas,‚Äù you might say, ‚Äúthis only works for simple apps!‚Äù
Oh my god, I get that all the time.
Not true. IcySky handles authentication, complex feed algorithms, user interactions, navigation, and various degrees of complexity without view models. Sure, it‚Äôs not finished yet, but the project is starting to be sizable. Ice Cubes has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times, and while it‚Äôs still on my ‚Äúold‚Äù architecture, I‚Äôve been slowly moving it away from ViewModel. It has more views without them than with them.
Millions use the medium iOS app, mostly SwiftUI nowadays, with very few view models (those are legacy SwiftUI we did in 2019 before my company was acquired and joined Medium). Whenever we build a new feature, we inject our services into the SwiftUI environment and build lightweight views around them. Those views hold various local states related to user interaction.

![](directory_stru.jpeg)

Don‚Äôt hesitate to abuse `.tasks(:id)` and `.onChange()` modifiers, those are great and act as a small state reducer to trigger side effects when a value is updated.
For example, here is a `headerView` from IcySky:

```swift
@Environment(BSkyClient.self) var client
@Environment(CurrentUser.self) var currentUser
  
private var headerView: some View {
    FeedsListTitleView(
      filter: $filter,
      searchText: $searchText,
      isInSearch: $isInSearch,
      isSearchFocused: $isSearchFocused
    )
    .task(id: searchText) {
      guard !searchText.isEmpty else { return }
      await searchFeed(query: searchText)
    }
    .onChange(of: isInSearch, initial: false) {
      guard !isInSearch else { return }
      Task { await fetchSuggestedFeed() }
    }
    .onChange(of: currentUser.savedFeeds.count) {
      switch filter {
      case .suggested:
        feeds = feeds.filter { feed in
          !currentUser.savedFeeds.contains { $0.value == feed.uri }
        }
      case .myFeeds:
        Task { await fetchMyFeeds() }
      }
    }
    .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
  }
```

It‚Äôs small and readable. It composes a title view, passing various states of the current view as binding to FeedsListTitleView.
.task(id:) is used to trigger a new search when the search query is updated from user input. Then we have two .onChange(of:) one to reset to a search placeholder when the search query is empty, and one to load and set user feeds when an environment value property is updated.
And this basically allows for a straightforward app setup, if we take the whole IcySky setup and simplify it a bit:

```swift
@main
struct IcySkyApp: App {
  @Environment(\.scenePhase) var scenePhase

  @State var client: BSkyClient?
  @State var auth: Auth = .init()
  @State var currentUser: CurrentUser?
  @State var router: AppRouter = .init(initialTab: .feed)
  @State var isLoadingInitialSession: Bool = true
  @State var postDataControllerProvider: PostContextProvider = .init()

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      TabView(selection: $router.selectedTab) {
        if client != nil && currentUser != nil {
          ForEach(AppTab.allCases) { tab in
            AppTabRootView(tab: tab)
              .tag(tab)
              .toolbarVisibility(.hidden, for: .tabBar)
          }
        } else {
          ProgressView()
            .containerRelativeFrame([.horizontal, .vertical])
        }
      }
      .environment(client)
      .environment(currentUser)
      .environment(auth)
      .environment(router)
      .environment(postDataControllerProvider)
      .modelContainer(for: RecentFeedItem.self)
      .sheet(
        item: $router.presentedSheet,
        content: { presentedSheet in
          switch presentedSheet {
          case .auth:
            AuthView()
              .environment(auth)
          case let .fullScreenMedia(images, preloadedImage, namespace):
            FullScreenMediaView(
              images: images,
              preloadedImage: preloadedImage,
              namespace: namespace
            )
          }
        }
      )
      .task(id: auth.sessionLastRefreshed) {
        if let newConfiguration = auth.configuration {
          await refreshEnvWith(configuration: newConfiguration)
          if router.presentedSheet == .auth {
            router.presentedSheet = nil
          }
        } else if auth.configuration == nil && !isLoadingInitialSession {
          router.presentedSheet = .auth
        }
        isLoadingInitialSession = false
      }
      .task(id: scenePhase) {
        if scenePhase == .active {
          await auth.refresh()
        }
      }
```

All of the environments are initialized at app launch and injected in the view hierarchy. So they can be retrieved by any view. If you look at the task(id:) modifiers, you‚Äôll see that I‚Äôm handling Auth there. The app authentication state is derived from the Auth environment and expressed at the app level to have a side effect in the router, which will then present or dismiss the login screen.
The key is proper separation of concerns:

* **Models**: Your data structures and business logic
* **Services**: Network clients, databases, utilities (injected via Environment)
* **Views**: Pure state representations that orchestrate user interactions

## SwiftData: The Perfect Example

If you need more evidence that Apple designed SwiftUI to work without ViewModels, look no further than SwiftData. Apple‚Äôs own data persistence framework is the perfect case study for why fighting the framework‚Äôs design leads to unnecessary complexity.
SwiftData was built from the ground up to work directly within SwiftUI views using property wrappers like @Query, @Model, and the @Environment(\.modelContext). Here's how natural it feels when you embrace the framework:

```swift
struct BookListView: View {
    @Query private var books: [Book]
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @State private var showingAddBook = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(books) { book in
                    BookRowView(book: book)
                        .swipeActions {
                            Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                                deleteBook(book)
                            }
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Books")
            .toolbar {
                Button("Add Book") {
                    showingAddBook = true
                }
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $showingAddBook) {
                AddBookView()
            }
        }
    }
    
    private func deleteBook(_ book: Book) {
        modelContext.delete(book)
        try? modelContext.save()
    }
}
```

Clean, simple, and direct. The @Query property wrapper automatically handles data fetching, change observation, and UI updates. The model context is available right where you need it.
Now imagine trying to force this through a ViewModel:

```swift
// DON'T DO THIS - Fighting the framework
@Observable
class BookListViewModel {
    private var modelContext: ModelContext
    var books: [Book] = []
    
    init(modelContext: ModelContext) {
        self.modelContext = modelContext
        fetchBooks() // Manual data fetching
    }
    
    private func fetchBooks() {
        // Manual descriptor creation
        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Book>()
        do {
            books = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
        } catch {
            // Error handling
        }
    }
    
    func deleteBook(_ book: Book) {
        modelContext.delete(book)
        try? modelContext.save()
        fetchBooks() // Manual refresh - yuck!
    }
    
    func refreshBooks() {
        fetchBooks()
    }
}

struct BookListView: View {
    @State private var viewModel: BookListViewModel
    
    init(modelContext: ModelContext) {
        _viewModel = State(initialValue: BookListViewModel(modelContext: modelContext))
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        // Same UI code, but now we need manual refresh calls
        // and lose automatic change observation
    }
}
```

Look at all that boilerplate! You‚Äôre manually fetching data, manually refreshing after changes, and losing SwiftData‚Äôs automatic change observation. You‚Äôve turned a few lines of declarative code into a complex imperative mess.
The @Query property wrapper isn't just convenient - it's smart. It automatically:

* Fetches your data
* Observes changes in the underlying store
* Updates the UI when data changes
* Handles sorting and filtering efficiently
* Manages memory and performance optimizations

When you move this logic into a ViewModel, you lose all these benefits and have to implement them manually. You‚Äôre literally fighting against the framework‚Äôs design.

Even more complex scenarios work beautifully with SwiftData‚Äôs view-centric approach:

```swift
struct AuthorBooksView: View {
    let author: Author
    
    @Query private var books: [Book]
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    
    init(author: Author) {
        self.author = author
        // Dynamic queries work seamlessly
        let predicate = #Predicate<Book> { book in
            book.author?.id == author.id
        }
        _books = Query(filter: predicate, sort: \.title)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        List(books) { book in
            BookRowView(book: book)
        }
        .navigationTitle(author.name)
    }
}
```

This is the beauty of SwiftUI and SwiftData working together as designed. No ViewModels, no manual data management, just clean, declarative code that‚Äôs easy to understand and maintain.
Apple didn‚Äôt create SwiftData to work with ViewModels, they created it to work directly with SwiftUI views because that‚Äôs the most natural and efficient pattern for the framework.

## The testing Reality

‚ÄúHow do you test this?‚Äù is the next question I always get.
Here‚Äôs the truth: testing SwiftUI views provides minimal value. Your views should be so simple that bugs are immediately visible. What you should test are your building blocks ‚Äî your network clients, your data models, your business logic.
If you want to test your views, do UI automation and E2E tests.
With my approach:

* Test your BlueSkyClient thoroughly with unit tests
* Test your data models and transformations
* Use SwiftUI previews for visual regression testing
* Let your views be simple state expressions

Sometimes a view grows beyond what‚Äôs comfortable in a single file. That‚Äôs your signal to split it, not to add a ViewModel. In IcySky, I have compound views like:

```swift
struct PostDetailView: View {
    let post: Post
    @State private var isExpanded: Bool = false
    
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack(spacing: 0) {
                PostHeaderView(post: post)
                PostContentView(post: post)
                PostActionsView(post: post, isExpanded: $isExpanded)
                PostRepliesView(postId: post.id)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each subview handles its own state and interactions. No ViewModel coordination needed. Use State and Binding to manage the data flow between your views.
But if you want to test your view with introspection, I‚Äôve been using a great library for a while, ViewInspector:

[Github ViewInspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector)

If you want to test your view representation other than with a snapshot test, you can do so using ViewInspector. For example, here is how we test our notifications Text renderer in the Medium iOS app.

```swift
@MainActor
final class ActivityTextBuilderTestsTests: XCTestCase {
  func test_follow_activity() async {
    let activity = GQL.Activity(notificationType: "users_following_you",
                                notificationName: UUID().uuidString,
                                isUnread: false,
                                occurredAt: 0,
                                actor: .init(id: "test", name: "Test user"))
    let build = ActivityTextBuilder(activity: activity)
    let text = try! build.buildActorText().inspect().text().string()
    XCTAssertEqual(text, "Test user started following you")
  }

  func test_catalog_recommend() async {
    let activity = GQL.Activity(notificationType: "catalog_recommended",
                                notificationName: UUID().uuidString,
                                isUnread: false,
                                occurredAt: 0,
                                actor: .init(id: "test", name: "Test user"),
                                catalog: .init(id: "test", name: "Test catalog"))
    let build = ActivityTextBuilder(activity: activity)
    let actorText = try! build.buildActorText().inspect().text().string()
    let contentText = try! build.buildContentText().inspect().text().string()
    XCTAssertEqual(actorText, "Test user clapped for")
    XCTAssertEqual(contentText, " Test catalog")
  }
}
```

This is useful to confirm that building your view with one input gives you the expected and consistent output.

## The 2025 Reality

As we head deeper into 2025, SwiftUI has matured. We have @Observable, improved Environment handling, and better async support, task lifecycle, etc‚Ä¶ The tools are there to build complex apps without the overhead of ViewModels.
Almost all the view lifecycle essentials are at the view level, and it‚Äôs tough to build around the view because it means forwarding many things outside of the view itself.
I‚Äôll reconsider ViewModel in SwiftUI when/if Apple provides a way to access the environment outside the view. I know you can do it with a library like TCA, but to me, the only canon is vanilla SwiftUI.
So, if you could do something like the code below, where with a macro, you could associate a class with a view and access its injected environment object and values, it would open many possibilities for even cleaner code.

```swift
@Observable
@ObservableWithEnvironment<UserListView>
class UserListDataSource {
    @Environment(\.databaseService) var database
    
    var users: [String] = []
    
    func fetch() async - {
        self.users = await database.fetch()
    }
}

struct UserListView: View {
    @State private var dataSource = UserListDataSource()
    
    var body: some View {
        List(dataSource.users, id: \.self) { user in
            Text(user)
        }
        .task {
            await dataSource.fetch()
        }
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters

Every ViewModel you add is:

* More complexity to maintain
* More objects to keep in sync
* More indirection between intent and action
* More cognitive overhead for your team

ViewModels are also an easy way to bloat. You'll have a great time if you force yourself to split your views into the smallest possible unit. ViewModel, like Controller in MVC, encourages you to take all your logic code and shove it outside so it can look ‚Äúclean‚Äù
SwiftUI gives you powerful primitives: @State, @Environment, @Observable, Bindable/Binding.Use them. Trust the framework. Your future self will thank you.

## The Bottom Line

In 2025, there‚Äôs no excuse for cluttering your SwiftUI apps with unnecessary ViewModels. Embrace the framework‚Äôs design. Let your views be simple, pure expressions of state. Focus your testing and complexity on the parts that matter ‚Äî your business logic and services.
Your SwiftUI apps will be cleaner, more maintainable, and more enjoyable to work on.
