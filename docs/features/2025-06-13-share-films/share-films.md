As a user I want to be able to share films: On a film of my collection i click on the Apple standard "share" logo and get the standard dialogue on how to share (i.e. iMessage, email... or copy link). This link is then sent (let's say via iMessage) to my friend.

My friend gets the link on iMessage, clicks it and the Filmz2 app opens with the new film.

For him the new film has different areas:

* The IMDB film part about the film itself
* His "My Data" section that he can edit
* A section "Filmz rating" in which he sees the average rating of other filmz users.

When sending i can select wether my comments should be sent along. If so, they are copied over into the My Data/comments field of the recieving user.

In the receiving user's My Data/Recommended by my name appears. But the receiving user can overwrite it.
