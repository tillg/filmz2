# Filmz2 Development Session Context

## Session Summary

This session focused on implementing an "Add to Collection" feature and refactoring the architecture to use an ID-only pattern with cached metadata.

## Completed Work

### 1. Add to Collection Feature

- Created `MyFilm` model for user's personal film collection
- Implemented `MyFilmsStore` service for collection management
- Added `AddToCollectionButton` component for one-tap adding
- Created `CollectionView` with tabs for All/Watched/Unwatched films
- Fixed iOS/macOS compatibility issues

### 2. MyFilm Detail View

- Built `MyFilmDetailView` with full editing capabilities
- Extracted shared components from `IMDBFilmDetailView`:
  - `FilmPosterSection`
  - `FilmInfoRow`
  - Other reusable components
- Added comprehensive tests

### 3. ID-Only Architecture Refactor

**Critical Change**: Refactored from storing all film data in MyFilm to storing only the IMDB ID

- Created `CachedIMDBFilm` model for persistent film metadata caching
- Updated `MyFilm` to only store:
  - `imdbID` (reference to film)
  - User-specific data (rating, watched status, notes, etc.)
- Modified `OMDBSearchService` to implement cache-first strategy:
  - Check `CachedIMDBFilm` before API calls
  - 30-day cache staleness check
  - Automatic cache population
- Updated `MyFilmDetailView` to fetch film details asynchronously

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` with ID-only pattern explanation
- Updated `DATA_STRUCTURES.md` to reflect new model separation
- Added comprehensive header comments to all model files explaining their role

## Key Architecture Decisions

### ID-Only Pattern Benefits

1. **No Data Duplication**: Each film's metadata stored exactly once
2. **Offline Access**: Persistent cache enables full offline functionality
3. **Smart API Usage**: Cache-first approach minimizes API calls
4. **Clean Separation**: User data clearly separated from movie metadata
5. **Future-Ready**: Enables shared collections or social features
6. **Efficient Storage**: Smaller footprint for user collections

### Cache Strategy

- 30-day freshness policy
- Cache-first approach (check cache before API)
- Automatic cache population when films added to collection
- Persistent storage using SwiftData

## Current State

- All requested features implemented and working
- Documentation fully updated
- Code committed and pushed to repository
- Architecture refactored for scalability

## Models Overview

### MyFilm (User Collection)

```swift
@Model
final class MyFilm {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: UUID
    @Attribute(.unique) var imdbID: String  // Reference to film

    // User-specific data
    var myRating: Int?
    var dateAdded: Date
    var watched: Bool
    var dateWatched: Date?
    var audience: AudienceType?
    var recommendedBy: String?
    var notes: String?
}
```

### CachedIMDBFilm (Metadata Cache)

```swift
@Model
final class CachedIMDBFilm {
    @Attribute(.unique) var imdbID: String
    // All film metadata fields...
    var lastFetched: Date
    var dataVersion: Int

    var isStale: Bool {
        // Returns true if older than 30 days
    }
}
```

## Build and Test Instructions

**CRITICAL**: Always use Make commands for building and testing. Never use direct xcodebuild or other build tools.

### Building the Project

```bash
make build          # Build the project
make build-release  # Build release configuration
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test          # Run all tests
make test-ui       # Run UI tests only
make test-unit     # Run unit tests only
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
make lint          # Run all linting
make format        # Format code
```

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever any Markdown (.md) file is created or modified, you MUST run:

```bash
make lint-fix && make lint
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
make clean build test lint  # Full clean build with testing and linting
```

All team members and AI assistants must use these Make targets exclusively. Do not use direct xcodebuild commands.

## Next Steps (Optional)

No explicit next steps requested. The implementation is complete and functional. Potential future enhancements could include:

- Export/import functionality for collections
- Social features (sharing collections)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Batch operations on collections
